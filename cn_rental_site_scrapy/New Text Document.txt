Ok the data is ready, it was easier than I thought!

I have provided a CSV file and a KML file.

The KML file is a map of china with polygons for each area of China
The CSV file is a list of all of the polygons in the KML

Column D in the CSV represents the <name> tag in the KML.

We need to have a unique value in the <name> tag, currently the majority of the polygons have unique names.
For the polygons without unique names we have to give them a unique name, this name is in column E.

You will need to change the non-unique <name> values in the KML with the corresponding names in Column D.

Once you have done that, we will have a KML file with unique <name> values

Next.

After scraping all of the properties in the website, you will have a csv file of every Studio, One Bedroom, Two Bedroom and Three Bedroom property on the website with their coordinates.

Using the coordinates you will check the KML to assign each property to a polygon.

This is how you will fill in Column A in the template.
